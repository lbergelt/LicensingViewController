The\r\nfonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,\r\nredistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\r\nnames are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\r\nhowever, cannot be released under any other type of license.

This may\r\ninclude source files, build scripts and documentation.\r\n\r\n\"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the\r\ncopyright statement(s).\r\n\r\n\"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as\r\ndistributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\r\n\r\n\"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\r\nor substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\r\nOriginal Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\r\nnew environment.\r\n\r\n\"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\r\nwriter or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\r\n\r\nPERMISSION AND CONDITIONS\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\r\nredistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\r\nSoftware, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\r\nin Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\r\n\r\n2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\r\nredistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\r\ncontains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be\r\nincluded either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\r\nin the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\r\nbinary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\r\n\r\n3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\r\nName(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\r\nCopyright Holder.
